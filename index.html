   <h2>About the Page</h2>
        <p>This is my first assignment in my software development class. the page will layout my portfolio and will have 2 sections namely;</p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>My Background</li>
                    <li>Why Join Software Development Class</li>
                </ol>
        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <img src="../images/bonface.jpg" alt="Image not Found">
        <p>My name is Bonface Mwangi Wairimu. I have a  BSC telecommunication and IT and currently doing MSC in Computer systems. In addition, I have Prince 2 Practioner certification in project management, ITIL and Cisco Networking Certifications. </p>
        <p>I am a transport and IP engineer with over 10 years experience handling various transport networks such as Optical networks such as <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/dense-wavelength-division-multiplexing-DWDM#:~:text=Dense%20wavelength%2Ddivision%20multiplexing%20(DWDM)%20is%20an%20optical%20fiber,separation%20of%20the%20data%20streams.">DWDM</a>, IP networks, Microwaves, Satellites and End to End Network Synchronisation. These technologies form the carrier network for any telecommunications or ISP network and carries varrying capacities across the network.I have not done much in programming but have done C++ and Java on coding and SQL on database as part of the degree programmes and have not done full software deployment activity.</p>
        <p>My hobbies are travelling and music and have interests in programming and large scale stock trading.</p>

        <h2>Why Join Software Development Class</h2>
        <p>Transport domain have been one of the area that is lagging behind in automation and there is alot of reliance on the equiment vendors to provide any kind of automation, service management applications and monitoring tools. As a lot of focus moves to automating and repetitive tasks, fast issues resolution as well as end to end integration of the transport network with upper layer systems including SDN scripting becomes part of transport domain activities. </p>
        <p>In addition to the work related applications, I should also be able to apply the knowledge in my day to day personal applications.</p>
